                <h2>Why Berlin?</h2>
                <h3>Metropolitan City with a Storied Past</h3>
                <p>
                    Berlin is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and
                    population. Its more than 3.85 million inhabitants make it the European Union's most populous city, according to
                    population within city limits. The greater urban area of Berlin is one of the States of Germany. Berlin is
                    surrounded
                    by the State of Brandenburg and Brandenburg's capital Potsdam is nearby. Berlin's urban area has a population of
                    around
                    4.5 million and is therefore the most populous urban area in Germany. The Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has
                    around 6.2 million inhabitants and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr region and
                    the
                    sixth biggest Metropolitan Region by GDP in the European Union.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Berlin was built along the banks of the Spree river, which flows into the Havel in the western borough of Spandau.
                    The
                    city incorporates lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs, the largest of which is Lake Müggelsee. About
                    one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks and gardens, rivers, canals, and lakes.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    First documented in the 13th century and at the crossing of two important historic trade routes, Berlin was
                    designated the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417-1701), Kingdom of Prussia (1701-1918), German Empire
                    (1871-1918), Weimar Republic (1919-1933), and Nazi Germany (1933-1945). Berlin has served as a scientific, artistic,
                    and
                    philosophical hub during the Age of Enlightenment, Neoclassicism, and the German revolutions of 1848–1849. During
                    the
                    Gründerzeit an industrialization-induced economic boom triggered a rapid population increase in Berlin. 1920s Berlin
                    was
                    the third-largest city in the world by population.
                
                <p>
                    After World War II and following Berlin's occupation, the city was split into West Berlin and East Berlin, divided
                    by
                    the Berlin Wall. East Berlin was declared capital of East Germany, while Bonn became the West German capital.
                    Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany.

                        <p>10178 Berlin, Germany</p>
                        
                        <h4>What I like About It</h4>
                        <p>Alexanderplatz is an active area with lots to do that also has a town-square feel to it.
                            One of my favorite parts about the area is the TV Tower and World Time Clock. I find them 
                            fascinating pieces of architecture and technology.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The area is named for Russian Tsar Aleksandr I, and is argued to be 
                            one of the most popular areas for tourists. Much of the area was destroyed 
                            during the Battle of Berlin, and was under Soviet control during the Cold War. 
                            It is here on November 4, 1989 that many East Germans gathered to protest the
                            socialist government.

                        <p>For some reason, I have always been obsessed with the history of the Cold War and the Soviet Union.
                            The DDR Museum is an amazing space to learn more about what life was like behind the Iron Curtain.
                            There are interactive exhibits, and permanent installations on what life was like for many East Germans during this 
                            unique time in history.

                            Visitors explore a recreated 5-room flat and can sit in the famous Trabant car with a driving simulation.
                            It is considered one of the world's most interactice museums.

                        <p>This is one of the largest continuous pieces of the Berlin Wall that survives today. 
                            And as someome who finds the history of the Cold War and the division of Berlin incredibly fascinating,
                            this is a great spot to physically enjoy the history on Berlin.
